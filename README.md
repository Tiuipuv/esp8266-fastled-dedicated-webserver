FastLED + ESP8266 + Dedicated Web Server
=========

Control an addressable LED strip with an ESP8266 via a web browser.

<B>NOTE:</B> If you would like to try the original master branch by jasoncoon, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Tiuipuv/esp8266-fastled-webserver). The instructions for the master are found in the Readme file.

* [3.3V to 5V Logic Level Shifter](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/SN74HCT245N/296-1612-5-ND/277258) (required if LEDs "glitch")

Recommended by [Adafruit NeoPixel "Best Practices"](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/best-practices) to help protect LEDs from current onrush:
* [1000ÂµF Capacitor](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ECA-1EM102/P5156-ND/245015)
* [300 to 500 Ohm resistor](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stackpole-electronics-inc/CF14JT470R/CF14JT470RCT-ND/1830342)

Features
--------
* Manage multiple Neopixel Strips
* Turn the NeoPixels on and off
* Adjust the brightness
* Change the display pattern
* Adjust the color

Web App
--------

![Web App](webapp.png)

Patterns are requested by the app from the ESP8266, so as new patterns are added, they're automatically listed in the app.

The web app is stored on the local server. The server files are found in the Web Server root directory.

The web app is a single page app that uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).  It has buttons for On/Off, a slider for brightness, a pattern selector, and a color picker (using [jQuery MiniColors](http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-minicolors)).  Event handlers for the controls are wired up, so you don't have to click a 'Send' button after making changes.  The brightness slider and the color picker use a delayed event handler, to prevent from flooding the ESP8266 web server with too many requests too quickly.

By hosting on a local server, there is virtual no limitation to file size / app scalability, and changes are very easy to manage.

Installing
-----------
The app is installed via the Arduino IDE which can be [downloaded here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). The ESP8266 boards will need to be added to the Arduino IDE which is achieved as follows. Click File > Preferences and copy and paste the URL "http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json" into the Additional Boards Manager URLs field. Click OK. Click Tools > Boards: ... > Boards Manager. Find and click on ESP8266 (using the Search function may expedite this). Click on Install. After installation, click on Close and then select your ESP8266 board from the Tools > Board: ... menu.

The app depends on the following libraries. They must either be downloaded from GitHub and placed in the Arduino 'libraries' folder, or installed as [described here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) by using the Arduino library manager.

* [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
* [Arduino WebSockets](https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets)

Download the app code from GitHub using the green Clone or Download button from [the GitHub project fork page](https://github.com/Tiuipuv/esp8266-fastled-webserver) and click Download ZIP. Decompress the ZIP file, placing the Web Server on the dedicated web server pc, and the arduino sketches in your Arduino folder.

Running the dedicated webserver requires Node.js. This can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) by clicking the LTS button. After Node.js is installed, navigate to the directory with static_server.js and run it by typing the cmd 'node static_server.js' in that directory. Once the server is running, you can access the webpage at the computers ip address by typing http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:80 into your browser.

To connect each ESP to wifi, create a 'Secret.h' file in the Arduino sketch directory. This file is included in the build, but is ignored on Github through the '.gitignore file'. This ensures that no wifi ssid or passwords are shared on different branches of this project. Enter your wi-fi network SSID and password in the Secret.h file, and upload the sketch using the Upload button. Additional instructions for 'Secret.h' can be found in the main .ino file.

REST Web services
-----------------

The firmware implements basic [RESTful web services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) using the ESP8266WebServer library.  Current values are requested with HTTP GETs, and values are set with POSTs using query string parameters.
